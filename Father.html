			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar of this family as I introduce my father for he has been our stronghold and refuge when life gets hard each day. When I have problems in academics or even in practicality about life, I ask my father about it. Yes we often squabble for our different perspectives in life but I always get that point where my father instills me the knowledge and prudent decisions to come up with. He is a Duterte sympathizer and I am his politically neutral opponent who supports the late Miriam Defensor-Santiago.  We often have various debates every time the news in the television opens with a connection with the current chaotic administration. My father never yields to my argument and we often use too much time presenting our rebuttals. For me, it was stressful because I can see the flaws in this administration but my father always see a glimmer of hope and thinks that Duterte is just a creative thinker. So much for this, I learned many things through my father because of his teachings and holy affiliation with God. </p></font>
