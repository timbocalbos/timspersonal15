			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle is my mother, Marly, who is always happy and contented in her life. She works every time, 24/7 and still never forget to bring a smile in her pocket. My mother is one of my inspirations to move forward in life because someday I want to give her the best treatment she deserves. In all those hardships and struggles she face when she’s still a young adult and the opportunities she missed during her time. My mother didn’t finish her college career because of inability to pay for her tuition during that time. That’s why my mother’s cognition become relevant when she worked at the age of 18 years old in Amkor Anam Technology as an operator and now she’s the section manager of the company that holds numerous employees. She’s one of a kind for the reason that she is always the mood changer of the family and I’ve to incorporate that attitude.</p></font>
